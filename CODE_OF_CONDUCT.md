# Agentgateway Community Code of Conduct

All members of the agentgateway community must abide by the [Linux Foundation projects Code of Conduct](https://lfprojects.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).
Only by respecting one another can we build a strong and collaborative community.

## Generative AI Policy

While agentgateway is a project designed to enable AI use cases, first and foremost it is a project by humans, for humans.
Usage of AI during contributions must abide by the [Linux Foundation Generative AI policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/generative-ai).

In addition, please:

* Refrain from generating issues, comments, or PR descriptions with AI.
* Refrain from "vibe coding". AI should be used to assist and accelerate code that you (the human!) would write on your own. You should only submit code that you fully understand and take ownership of, and that you would be able to explain and justify to a reviewer.
* Make sure that you have tested the changes and verify the code works as expected! If you have used AI to help write tests, make sure the tests are useful and are testing the feature correctly.
* When using (non-trivial) AI assistance, please indicate this.

These policies help ensure that the code base is kept at a high level of quality.
Additionally, it ensures maintainers do not waste time reviewing low-quality AI-generated code.

Issues or PRs that appear to violate these guidelines may be closed without review.
